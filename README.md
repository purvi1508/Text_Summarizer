# Text_Summarizer

The project aims to develop a web application that generates summaries of provided texts using custom word or sentence length. The application consists of a frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a backend implemented using the Flask framework.

The frontend of the application provides a user-friendly interface where users can input text that they want to summarize. It allows users to specify the desired length of the summary in terms of either the number of words or the number of sentences. The frontend is designed using HTML for structuring the content, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for interactivity and handling user inputs.

On the backend, Flask, a Python web framework, is utilized to handle the processing and generation of the text summaries. When a user submits a text for summarization, the input is sent to the Flask server via an HTTP request. The server-side code, written in Python, takes the input text and processes it using natural language processing techniques.

The summarization algorithm analyzes the input text and applies techniques such as text ranking, sentence scoring, or machine learning models to determine the most relevant sentences or key phrases. Based on the user's specified length (either in words or sentences), the algorithm selects the most important information and constructs a concise summary.

Once the summary is generated, the Flask backend sends the result back to the frontend, where it is displayed to the user. The user can then view the summary and make any necessary adjustments to the desired length to refine the output.
